# Verdikta Applications - General Development Rules

## Project Overview
This is a monorepo containing Verdikta integration examples:
- `example-bounty-program/` - AI-powered bounty/job system with IPFS integration
- `example-frontend/` - Reference implementation for Verdikta queries
- `docs/` - Documentation for the project

## Key Principles
1. **Always look for existing code** before creating new implementations
2. **Avoid duplication** - check for similar functionality in the codebase
3. **Keep files under 200-300 lines** - refactor when exceeding this
4. **Focus on relevant code** - don't touch unrelated areas
5. **Test thoroughly** - especially when changing core functionality
6. **Write clear documentation** - update docs when adding features

## Code Quality
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write modular and reusable components
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add input validation for all user inputs
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Environment Awareness
Write code that accounts for different environments:
- `dev` - Development with verbose logging
- `test` - Testing with mock data
- `prod` - Production with optimized settings

## Before Making Changes
1. Understand the existing implementation
2. Check if similar functionality exists elsewhere
3. Review related tests
4. Consider impact on other parts of the system
5. Update documentation if needed

## When Fixing Bugs
1. Understand why the test is failing
2. Only change test logic if thoroughly convinced the test is wrong
3. Prefer fixing implementation over changing tests
4. Document the fix in comments if complex

## Documentation Requirements
- Update README.md for user-facing features
- Update technical docs for architecture changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Create guides for new workflows
