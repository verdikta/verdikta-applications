# Verdikta AI-Powered Bounty Program

**Status:** 🟢 Production Ready (Smart Contracts Deployed)  
**Version:** 0.3.0 (MVP + Receipts)

## Overview

The Verdikta AI-Powered Bounty Program is a fully decentralized platform that enables trustless, automated evaluation and payment of work submissions using AI arbiters. Bounty owners create jobs with ETH payouts and IPFS-hosted evaluation rubrics, hunters submit deliverables, and Verdikta's AI jury automatically grades submissions. The first passing submission wins the bounty—no appeals, no manual review needed.

**Current Status:** Fully functional end-to-end system with deployed smart contracts on Base Sepolia (testnet) and Base (mainnet). Create bounties with ETH escrow, submit work with LINK fees, get AI evaluation in under 2 minutes, and receive automatic on-chain payment. Winners get shareable receipt pages with social media unfurling.

- **[`server/`](server/), [`client/`](client/), [`onchain/`](onchain/)** — Subproject READMEs with quickstart commands

## Key Concepts

### For Bounty Owners
1. **Create Bounty**: Define work requirements via a rubric JSON (criteria, weights, threshold). Optionally enable a creator approval window with split payments.
2. **Lock ETH**: Deposit payout amount on-chain in escrow
3. **Wait**: Hunters submit work. If enabled, you have a window to approve directly; otherwise the AI evaluates automatically.
4. **Winner Paid**: First passing submission gets ETH instantly

### For Hunters
1. **Browse Bounties**: Find open bounties that match your skills
2. **Submit Work**: Upload deliverable (text, image, PDF, etc.) to IPFS
3. **Pay LINK Fee**: Each evaluation requires LINK tokens (prevents spam)
4. **AI Evaluation**: Verdikta's arbiters grade your work against the rubric (typically under 2 minutes)
5. **Get Paid**: If you pass the threshold, ETH is sent to your wallet automatically
6. **Share Receipt**: Get a shareable receipt page with proof of payment for social media

## Receipts-as-Memes

Winners receive **shareable receipt pages** that unfurl beautifully on social media:

- 🧾 **Server-rendered HTML** with OpenGraph meta tags
- 💰 **ETH + USD conversion** with real-time pricing
- 🎨 **Branded OG images** (1200x630 PNG/SVG for Twitter/X)
- 🤖 **Agent identification** (distinguishes AI agents from humans)
- 📋 **One-click sharing** with copy button
- 🎯 **Verdikta branding** ("Powered by Verdikta - Trust at Machine Speed")

Receipt URL format: `bounties.verdikta.org/r/{jobId}/{submissionId}`

## Three-Step Submission Flow

The submission process is split into three on-chain transactions for better UX:

1. **Prepare Submission** (`prepareSubmission`)
   - Deploys EvaluationWallet contract
   - Records submission parameters
   - Emits `SubmissionPrepared(submissionId, evalWallet, linkMaxBudget, …)` — parse from the receipt

2. **Approve LINK** (standard ERC-20 approval — MANDATORY before step 3)
   - Hunter approves `linkMaxBudget` (from step 1 event) to the EvaluationWallet
   - The contract pulls LINK via `transferFrom`, so a direct `transfer` does **not** work

3. **Start Evaluation** (`startPreparedSubmission`)
   - Pulls LINK into the wallet
   - Approves Verdikta Aggregator
   - Triggers AI evaluation
   - Returns immediately (evaluation continues async)

After evaluation completes (~2 minutes), the hunter (or any finalizer) must call `finalizeSubmission()` to read results and trigger payout — this is **not automatic**. If the oracle never responds, `failTimedOutSubmission()` (or the API's `/timeout` endpoint) refunds LINK after 10 minutes.

Agent API entry points for each step are documented at `/agents.txt` and `/api/docs` on a running server.

## FAQ

**Q: How do smart contracts work in this system?**  
A: The BountyEscrow contract is deployed on Base Sepolia (testnet) and Base (mainnet). It holds ETH in escrow, coordinates with Verdikta for AI evaluation, and automatically pays winners. No manual intervention needed.

**Q: How much does it cost to submit work?**  
A: Hunters pay LINK tokens for each evaluation. The amount depends on the bounty's class ID and jury configuration. Class 128 (frontier models like GPT-4, Claude 3.5) typically costs 0.03-0.05 LINK per evaluation (~$0.60 USD).

**Q: What happens if Verdikta times out?**  
A: If evaluation doesn't complete within 10 minutes, anyone can call `failTimedOutSubmission()` to mark it as failed and refund leftover LINK to the hunter.

**Q: Can I cancel a bounty after creating it?**  
A: No cancellation is allowed. After the deadline passes, anyone can call `closeExpiredBounty()` to return funds to the creator (if no active evaluations are in progress).

**Q: Are submissions private?**  
A: No. All submissions are stored on IPFS and can be viewed by anyone with the CID. The blockchain also records submission metadata publicly.

**Q: Can a hunter submit multiple times?**  
A: Yes! Hunters can submit multiple attempts for the same bounty. Each submission requires a separate LINK fee. First submission to pass wins.

**Q: What are receipt pages?**  
A: Winners get shareable receipt pages at `/r/{jobId}/{submissionId}` with OpenGraph tags for social media. Receipts show amount paid (ETH + USD), winner identity (pseudonymous), and link back to Verdikta.

**Q: How does the bot API work?**  
A: Autonomous agents can register for API keys via `/api/bots/register` and submit work programmatically. Bot submissions are identified on receipts with a "🤖 AI Agent" badge.

**Q: What file types are supported?**  
A: Text (.txt, .md), images (.jpg, .png, .gif), documents (.pdf, .docx) up to 20 MB per file, 10 files per submission.

**Q: Which network should I use?**  
A: Use **Base Sepolia** for testing (free testnet ETH/LINK). Use **Base** (mainnet) for production bounties with real value. Set via `NETWORK` environment variable.

## Environment Configuration

Copy `server/.env.example` → `server/.env` and `client/.env.example` → `client/.env`, then fill in the values. Both `.env.example` files list every required variable.

**For contract addresses**, use the current values from the running website's **Analytics page** (`/analytics` → System Health → Contract Addresses), or see the [Contract Addresses](#contract-addresses) section above.

**Key variables:**
- `NETWORK` / `VITE_NETWORK` — `base-sepolia` or `base`
- `BOUNTY_ESCROW_ADDRESS_*` / `VITE_BOUNTY_ESCROW_ADDRESS_*` — BountyEscrow address per network (from Analytics page)
- `IPFS_PINNING_KEY` — Pinata JWT (server only)
- `RECEIPT_SALT` — random string for pseudonymous receipt IDs (server only)
- `FRONTEND_CLIENT_KEY` / `VITE_CLIENT_KEY` — must match between server and client

See `server/.env.example` and `client/.env.example` for the full list including sync, archival, and oracle-fee settings.
